IJO is an open-source, light-weight server manager.

## Installation

As IJO is still being developed, these instructions are designed for contributors setting up their own local version of IJO.
Once IJO reaches a working version, these instructions will be updated.

### Requirements

- NodeJS
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Steps

Fork this repository to your GitHub account, then clone it locally using the following commands.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/ijo
cd ijo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ijo-sm/ijo.git
git fetch upstream
```

You can then run IJO with `npm run start`.
